I'm a PhD student in Machine Learning and Statistics at Inria in the PreMEDiCal team, supervised by Julie Josse and Aur√©lien Bellet. My research aims at developping Causal Inference methods for observational studies in a Federated Learning setting. 

Fields of interests:
  * Causal Inference: treatment effect estimation, policy learning, personalized medicine
  * Federated Learning: decentralized learning, privacy-preserving learning and fairness
  * Latent Variable Models: missing data, VAEs
  * Optimization and Learning Theory: online learning
